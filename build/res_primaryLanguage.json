      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Welcome to my page thatâ€™s all about me. Before transitioning into web and software development, I studied math and physics at the University of Minnesota. At the University of Minnesota, I took the coding bootcamp where I learned full-stack development. While I was in the bootcamp I discovered myself enjoying the technical and computer driven aspects of programming and developed a passion for it. I gained knowledge on JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node, Mongo dB, Bootstrap and React. I am excited for my future as a full-stack developer and working on new projects. Please reach out to me, I have linked my LinkedIn profile, GitHub and contact information on the bottom of the page. ðŸ’œ",
